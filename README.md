This is my second project in conjuction with The Odin Project.
I finally learned html and css. It was a process because I was distracted with  a lot of stuffs but I managed to finish it.
I made my pet the star of the website because I really love him and to enjoy the process of learning. 
I can say I made progress from my previous project and learned a lot but I know there is way way more to learn and I am excited for that.
Whoever is reading this I hope you liked my project!
